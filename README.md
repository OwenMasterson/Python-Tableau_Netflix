# Python-Tableau_Netflix

# Project Overview
This project analyses Netflix’s global catalogue using a cleaned and structured dataset of movies and TV shows. After transforming the raw data in Python, the analysis explores how content varies across ratings, genres, countries, and time. The findings highlight Netflix’s strong emphasis on mature and teen‑oriented programming, a rapid rise in content production from the early 2000s onward, and clear regional disparities in global content distribution. Tableau dashboards bring these patterns to life, revealing how Netflix’s library reflects broader trends in streaming growth, international production, and audience targeting.

# Executive Summary
The code & dashboards provides a comprehensive overview of global movie and TV‑show patterns, highlighting how content distribution varies across ratings, countries, genres, and time. The analysis shows that TV‑MA, TV‑14, and TV‑PG dominate the catalogue, reflecting a strong emphasis on mature and teen‑oriented programming. When examining release trends, the data reveals a sharp increase in content production from the early 2000s onward, with a significant surge between 2015 and 2019, aligning with the rapid expansion of streaming platforms.

# Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates how data can reveal the strategic decisions behind one of the world’s largest streaming platforms. By analysing Netflix’s catalogue across ratings, genres, countries, and release years, the work uncovers how the platform prioritises content, responds to global demand, and adapts to industry trends. The dashboards make these patterns visible and easy to interpret, turning a large, unstructured dataset into insights that support content planning, market analysis, and audience understanding. For anyone working in media, analytics, or digital strategy, this project shows how data‑driven storytelling can illuminate the forces shaping modern entertainment.

# Python
 This project begins with a full data‑cleaning workflow completed in Google Colab using Python and pandas. The goal was to transform the raw Netflix dataset into a structured, analysis‑ready format suitable for Tableau visualisation.


### Importing and Inspecting the Dataset
The raw dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for initial exploration. This included checking column types, identifying missing values, and reviewing the structure of key fields such as rating, country, date_added, and listed_in.

### Removing Unnecessary Columns
Several fields were dropped to streamline the dataset and focus on variables relevant to visual analysis. These included:
* show_id
* cast
* director
* description

This reduced noise and improved clarity for downstream Tableau work.

### Handling Missing Values
Missing values were addressed using a combination of:
*Filling missing country entries with the dataset’s most frequent country
*Dropping remaining rows with incomplete critical fields

This ensured consistency and prevented null‑related issues in Tableau.

# Converting and Cleaning Date Fields
The date_added column was converted into a proper datetime format, enabling accurate time‑based analysis and filtering in Tableau.

# Extracting a Primary Country
Many titles list multiple countries. To simplify geographic analysis, a new column was created to capture only the first listed country, representing the title’s principal origin.

# Creating an Age‑Group Classification
A custom ages column was generated by mapping Netflix ratings into broader demographic categories such as:
*Kids
*Older Kids
*Teens
*Adults

This made it easier to analyse content suitability and audience targeting.

# Exporting the Cleaned Dataset
The final cleaned DataFrame was exported as cleaned_data.csv, which was then imported into Tableau for dashboard creation.

# Content Ratings Distribution
The ratings analysis shows a strong concentration of titles in mature and teen‑oriented categories. TV‑MA, TV‑14, and TV‑PG dominate the catalogue, reflecting the platform’s focus on adult and young‑adult audiences. Movies and TV shows follow similar patterns, though TV shows have a noticeably higher share of TV‑MA content. Lower‑age ratings such as G, PG, and TV‑Y appear far less frequently, indicating that family‑oriented programming represents a smaller portion of the overall library.

# Release Trends Over Time
The release‑year chart highlights a dramatic rise in content production beginning in the early 2000s, with a sharp surge between 2015 and 2019. This period aligns with the rapid global expansion of streaming services and increased investment in original programming. TV shows grow steadily across the timeline, while movies show a more pronounced spike in the late 2010s. The trend suggests a strategic shift toward high‑volume content acquisition and production in recent years.

# Global Distribution of Titles
The geographic visualisation reveals a highly uneven global distribution of content. A small number of countries—most notably the United States, India, and the United Kingdom—contribute the majority of titles. These regions serve as major production hubs and dominate the platform’s catalogue. Many other countries show minimal representation, often with only a handful of titles, highlighting significant regional disparities in content availability.

# Ratings by Country
The heatmap provides a deeper look at how ratings vary across countries. High‑output regions such as the United States and India display a wide spread of ratings, indicating diverse content portfolios. Countries with smaller catalogues tend to cluster around a narrow set of ratings, often reflecting local production norms or limited licensing agreements. This comparison underscores how cultural, regulatory, and industry factors shape the types of content produced in different regions.

# Genre Distribution
The genre analysis shows that dramas, documentaries, comedies, and international content make up a substantial portion of the catalogue. TV shows dominate categories such as Kids’ TV and International TV, while movies are more prevalent in stand‑up comedy, documentaries, and family‑oriented genres. The presence of many multi‑genre combinations highlights the platform’s emphasis on cross‑category storytelling and broad audience appeal.

# Overall Insight
Together, these visuals provide a comprehensive view of how content varies across ratings, genres, countries, and time. The dashboard highlights clear patterns in global production, audience targeting, and catalogue strategy, offering valuable insights for content planning, localisation, and market analysis.

# Project Impact
This project demonstrates how data analysis can uncover the strategic decisions behind one of the world’s largest streaming platforms. By transforming a raw dataset into clear, structured insights, the work highlights how Netflix allocates its content investment, which regions dominate production, and how audience targeting has shifted over time. The dashboards make these patterns accessible to both technical and non‑technical audiences, supporting decisions in content planning, localisation, and market strategy. Beyond the streaming industry, the project showcases your ability to manage an end‑to‑end analytical workflow—cleaning data, engineering features, building visualisations, and communicating insights in a way that drives understanding and action.

# Limitations and Future Improvements
Limitations  
The dataset reflects a snapshot of Netflix’s catalogue at a single point in time, meaning it does not capture how titles are added or removed throughout the year. Some fields—such as cast, director, and detailed genre tags—were removed to streamline the analysis, which limits the depth of insights into creative contributors or multi‑genre relationships. Country information is often incomplete or inconsistently formatted, and extracting only the first listed country simplifies the data but may overlook co‑productions. Ratings classifications also vary across regions, which can introduce inconsistencies when grouping content into age categories.

Future Improvements  
Expanding the dataset to include multiple time periods would allow for a richer analysis of catalogue turnover and long‑term trends. Incorporating additional metadata—such as IMDb scores, runtime, or viewer engagement metrics—could deepen insights into content performance. A more advanced geographic model could account for co‑productions or regional licensing differences. Machine‑learning techniques could be introduced to cluster genres, predict content ratings, or identify emerging trends. Finally, integrating Python‑based statistical analysis alongside Tableau visuals would strengthen the analytical depth and open the door to more sophisticated storytelling.
