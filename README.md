# Content Ratings Distribution
The ratings analysis shows a strong concentration of titles in mature and teen‑oriented categories. TV‑MA, TV‑14, and TV‑PG dominate the catalogue, reflecting the platform’s focus on adult and young‑adult audiences. Movies and TV shows follow similar patterns, though TV shows have a noticeably higher share of TV‑MA content.

# Release Trends Over Time
The release‑year chart highlights a dramatic rise in content production beginning in the early 2000s, with a sharp surge between 2015 and 2019. This period aligns with the rapid global expansion of streaming services and increased investment in original programming. TV shows grow steadily across the timeline, while movies show a more pronounced spike in the late 2010s. The trend suggests a strategic shift toward high‑volume content acquisition and production in recent years.

# Global Distribution of Titles
The geographic visualisation reveals a highly uneven global distribution of content. A small number of countries—most notably the United States, India, and the United Kingdom—contribute the majority of titles. These regions serve as major production hubs and dominate the platform’s catalogue. Many other countries show minimal representation, often with only a handful of titles, highlighting significant regional disparities in content availability.

# Ratings by Country
The heatmap provides a deeper look at how ratings vary across countries. High‑output regions such as the United States and India display a wide spread of ratings, indicating diverse content portfolios. Countries with smaller catalogues tend to cluster around a narrow set of ratings, often reflecting local production norms or limited licensing agreements. This comparison underscores how cultural, regulatory, and industry factors shape the types of content produced in different regions.

# Genre Distribution
The genre analysis shows that dramas, documentaries, comedies, and international content make up a substantial portion of the catalogue. TV shows dominate categories such as Kids’ TV and International TV, while movies are more prevalent in stand‑up comedy, documentaries, and family‑oriented genres. The presence of many multi‑genre combinations highlights the platform’s emphasis on cross‑category storytelling and broad audience appeal.
